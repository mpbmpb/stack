<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<p align="center">

</p>
This is a short console app written as an exercise given in de udemy course C# Intermediate by Mosh Hamedani.
<br/>
<br/>
It is a simple implementation of a stack.
<br/>
<br/>
I wrote all of the exercises for this course using the TDD approach of writing tests first and then production code.
The tests are written using xUnit and Fluent Assertions.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Mosh Hamedani for making a comprehensive and easy to follow course. :star:
<br/>
<br/>
A list of commonly used resources that I found helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With
The code was written in Visual Studio.<br/>
The test coverage was measured with JetBrains dotCover.

* [Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2019)
* [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp)
* [xUnit](https://xunit.net)
* [Fluent Assertions](https://fluentassertions.com/)
* [dotCover](https://www.jetbrains.com/dotcover/)

### Specifications
The given specifications were:

* Design a class called Stack with three methods.
* void Push(object obj)
* object Pop()
* void Clear()
* The Push() method stores the given object on top of the stack. We use the “object” type here so we can store any objects inside the stack.
* The Pop() method removes the object on top of the stack and returns it. 
* The Clear() method removes all objects from the stack.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Visual Studio needs to be installed along with the dotnet core runtime and SDK
All can be installed by the Visual Studio installer.

* The installer can be found on this page 
```sh
[Visual Studio documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2019)
```

### Installation

1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to install the files
3. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mpbmpb/stack.git
```
3. go to the stack directory
```sh
cd stack
```
4. run the app from the terminal
```
dotnet run
```
5. or find the stack.sln file in your explorer and double click it.
   Visual Studio should take it from there.
